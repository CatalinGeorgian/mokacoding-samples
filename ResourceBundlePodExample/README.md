[Sharing assets across iOS projects with CocoaPods, Resource Bundle, and dynamically loaded fonts](http://www.mokacoding.com/2014/02/13/sharing-assets-with-cocoapods-resource-bundle-and-dynamically-loaded-fonts.html)

The [blog post](http://www.mokacoding.com/2014/02/13/sharing-assets-with-cocoapods-resource-bundle-and-dynamically-loaded-fonts.html) shows how to create a CocoaPods to share resources such as assets and fonts across multiple projects. The interesting parts are two:

* How to create a "Resource Bundle" using CocoaPods.
* How to dynamically load fonts in order to avoid touching the `Info.plist`.

The cool thing is that they are both very very simple. Have a look at the code!
