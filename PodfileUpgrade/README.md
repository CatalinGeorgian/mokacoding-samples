[A caveat when upgrading a Podfile](http://www.mokacoding.com/2014/03/28/upgrading-podfile.html)
===

In the [blog post](http://www.mokacoding.com/2014/03/28/upgrading-podfile.html) I share a gotcha found when upgrading an iOS project by either changing the name of a target, or changing the `Podfile` syntax into a modern one.

TL;DR the `libPodsXXX.a` generated by the previous configuration doesn't get removed, so you have to do it yourself.

To see the issue in action checkout the [`podfile-upgrade`](https://github.com/mokagio/mokacoding-samples/tree/podfile-upgrade) branch of the repo and look around the commits.
